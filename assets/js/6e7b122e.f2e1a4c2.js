In fact, researchers demonstrated in 2007 that by eavesdropping one BAC exchange (which was 3DES encrypted) from a few meters away, they could brute-force the keys in under a minute for some passports (Germany, Netherlands). They took advantage of known passport number patterns and the limited entropy of date-of-birth (people typically not older than 100, etc.) to shrink the brute force effort. Even without eavesdropping, another attack was possible: if an attacker had physical proximity, they could try to brute-force BAC by repeatedly attempting sessions (though this is slower and chips often have rate limits). But using a recorded session, one can test candidate MRZ keys offline by attempting to decrypt the transcript. As Henderson summarizes: \u201cthe combination of Triple DES encryption and a short MRZ means it\u2019s not very secure at all.\u201d.
