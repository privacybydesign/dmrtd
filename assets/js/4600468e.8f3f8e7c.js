In simpler terms, BAC uses information printed in the passport (MRZ) to derive encryption keys, and establishes a encrypted session between the chip and the reader. Only someone who has physically seen the passport (and thus knows the MRZ) can perform BAC successfully, thereby mitigating the risk of someone reading your passport data without your consent from a distance.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"eac":{"id":"eac","title":"EU Standards: Extended Access Control (EAC) and SAC","description":"While ICAO provides the global framework, the European Union has introduced additional standards on top of ICAO\u2019s to enhance security for its member states\u2019 passports. The EU\u2019s implementation is largely based on technical specifications developed by Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), in particular BSI TR-03110, which defines Extended Access Control (EAC) and related protocols. These EU-specific standards were introduced for \\"second generation\\" e-passports to protect sensitive biometric data (like fingerprints) with stronger mechanisms.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"DMRTD","description":"DMRTD is the Dart Library for Machine Readable Travel Document.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"pa":{"id":"pa","title":"Passive Authentication (PA)","description":"Passive Authentication is the cornerstone security feature of e-passports and the only one that is mandatory per ICAO standards. It provides data integrity and origin authentication. The essence of Passive Authentication is a digital signature on the data, created by the issuing authority, which the inspection system verifies against a trusted public key.","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"pace":{"id":"pace","title":"Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)","description":"PACE is a newer protocol (part of Supplemental Access Control, SAC) that was introduced to address weaknesses in BAC. While not part of the original EAC, it\u2019s worth mentioning as it\u2019s widely used in newer passports (particularly EU since 2014). PACE replaces BAC\u2019s static key handshake with an active diffie-hellman based key agreement using the MRZ (or CAN) as a password. The result is that it effectively thwarts eavesdropping attacks and brute-force guessing: an attacker cannot capture an encrypted exchange and later brute force the key because PACE\u2019s exchange is designed such that guessing the wrong password yields no verifiable info without interacting with the chip each time (a property of PAKE protocols).","sidebar":"docSidebar"},"standards":{"id":"standards","title":"Passport Standards","description":"ISO/IEC 14443 (Contactless Interface Standard)","sidebar":"docSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
